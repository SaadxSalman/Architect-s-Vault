# About the Architect

Hello! I am **saadxsalman**. This Static Site Generator (SSG) is a testament to the power of building your own tools from scratch.

### Why I Built This
Most modern SSGs (like Hugo or Gatsby) are incredible but can feel like a "black box." By building this tool, I’ve mastered:
1. **Asynchronous I/O:** Handling multiple file reads/writes without blocking the main thread.
2. **Path Resolution:** Managing absolute and relative paths across different operating systems.
3. **The Shadow DOM:** Understanding how Tailwind's Typography plugin interacts with standard HTML elements.
